Phishing is a type of online fraud (cyberattack) that deceives individuals into revealing sensitive information. It began in the mid-1990s when attackers posed as service representatives in emails to trick users into providing their passwords. Not much has changed in the last 30 years, except for the sophistication of these scammers. 

Every day, billions of fraudulent messages are sent by phishers to trick unsuspecting consumers into divulging sensitive information, like their banking password. Attackers have gone beyond email, and now use social media, phone texts, voice calls, QR codes and more. Tactics have also become more sophisticated, with attackers learning about consumer online habits and messaging them accordingly to be more convincing. AI tools have taken things up a notch, with over 80% of phishing emails now being generated with AI help to be more targeted. 

Here are some facts that highlight the pain inflicted by phishing on consumers.

### **Staggering Financial Toll**

* In **2024**, U.S. consumers lost over **$12.5 billion** to fraud, a **25% increase** over 2023; imposter scams alone accounted for **$2.95 billion** in losses, and email remained the most common initial contact method ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/resist-phishing-attacks), [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024)).

* Cyber scams across all contact channels in the U.S. totaled **$16 billion in 2024**, a **33% rise**, with **phishing/spoofing** generating around **193,000 complaints** ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/cyber-scams-are-skyrocketing-costing-americans-16b/)).

* Globally, phishing is projected to cost victims up to **$250 billion in 2024**, reflecting dramatic expansion in scale and impact ([sslinsights.com](https://sslinsights.com/phishing-statistics/)).

### **Escalating Sophistication & Reach**

* Consumers receive over **3.4 billion phishing emails per day**, making up about **1.2% of global email traffic**; phishing is involved in **36% of all cyber breaches**, and **94% of malware infections originate from phishing vectors** ([DeepStrike](https://deepstrike.io/blog/Phishing-Statistics-2025)).

* AI is fueling these scams: **82%** of phishing emails are now AI‑generated, and reports of phishing rose **466%** in Q1 2025 year over year ([Sift](https://sift.com/index-reports-ai-fraud-q2-2025/)).

* Even confident users struggle: **33%** say they could spot an AI scam, yet **20% admit** to falling for phishing in the past year; of those who suspected an AI scam, **27% were successfully defrauded** ([Sift](https://sift.com/index-reports-ai-fraud-q2-2025/)).

### **Mobile Threats: Smishing & Quishing**

* Smishing (SMS‑based phishing) is surging: **150% increase** in 2022, present in **75% of organizations in 2023**, with **30% of users** falling victim; average losses are about **$4,300 per incident** ([WifiTalents](https://wifitalents.com/smishing-statistics/)).

* “Quishing” — phishing via malicious QR codes — is now a growing threat in retail and public settings. Overlayed QR codes can download malware instantly, compromising banking details or personal data ([Adelaide Now](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/private-investigator-evan-frangos-gives-dire-warning-on-new-qr-code-scam-fleecing-thousands-of-dollars-from-people/news-story/e933c00250e9eb86b7ea49176d2da84c)).

### **Emotional and Psychological Fallout**

* Beyond monetary loss, identity theft leaves nearly **42% of victims** with diminished trust, lost peace of mind, or missed opportunities; **12%** lost over **$10,000** in reported cases ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Incogni_Official/comments/1igronb)).

* A recent psychological guide notes phishing leads to emotional trauma: shame, anxiety, and reluctance to disclose victimhood—often compounding recovery challenges ([Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/phishing-for-relief-overcoming-scams-11739921)).

## **How Phishing Works: Real‑World Examples**

* **Tech support scams:** In these scams, phishers prey on less tech-savvy consumers and convince them of a problem in their computer. The phishers offer to provide remote technical support. While "helping" the user, they ask the user to log into various websites and record their passwords. \~60% of consumers surveyed had encountered one in the past year, with typical losses around **$200 per incident** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support_scam)).

* **Voice‑phishing (vishing):** In these scams, phishers make calls posing as IRS or Immigration services and threaten to arrest the user unless they make a "bail" payment. These schemes have netted hundreds of millions in the past decade. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_phishing)).

* **Invoice phishing:** In such scams, phishers send an email posing as a vendor and demand payment. Famous incidents include Ubiquiti’s phishing loss of almost **$47 million in 2015**, and the 2016 hack of Google and Facebook via invoice phishing, which stole $100 million+ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing)).

## **How Consumers Can Protect Themselves**

### **1\. Know the Psychology of Deception**

* Scammers often exploit urgency, authority, fear, or familiarity. Recognizing emotional triggers (e.g. panic over a payment delay) helps you pause before responding ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/cyber-scams-are-skyrocketing-costing-americans-16b/)).

### **2\. Be Skeptical of Unexpected Contact**

* Avoid clicking links or opening attachments in unsolicited emails, texts, or calls—even if they appear plausible. When in doubt, go directly to the official websites and look up known phone numbers ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/resist-phishing-attacks)).

### **3\. Guard Your Device**

* Keep mobile operating systems and antivirus tools up to date. Be especially wary of scanning unknown QR codes or approving unsolicited app downloads (a common vector in quishing) ([Adelaide Now](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/private-investigator-evan-frangos-gives-dire-warning-on-new-qr-code-scam-fleecing-thousands-of-dollars-from-people/news-story/e933c00250e9eb86b7ea49176d2da84c)).

### **4\. Enhance Your Browser's Security**

* Always update your browser to the latest version. Make use of browser security extensions like a password manager, privacy protector and phishing site detector. Most of them are free, so there is no downside to using them.

### **5\. Manage Your Identity & Finances Proactively**

* Monitor financial statements and credit reports regularly; report losses or theft immediately to banks and authorities.
