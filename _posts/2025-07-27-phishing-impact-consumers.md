## **üõ° How Consumers Can Protect Themselves**

### **1\. Be Skeptical of Unexpected Contact**

* Avoid clicking links or opening attachments in unsolicited emails, texts, or calls‚Äîeven if they appear plausible. When in doubt, verify directly via official websites or known phone numbers ([WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/resist-phishing-attacks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### **2\. Rely on Multifactor ‚Äî But Choose Smartly**

* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially phishing‚Äëresistant methods (like hardware keys or app-based consent) instead of SMS or TOTP codes which can be intercepted or bypassed.

### **3\. Guard Your Device**

* Keep mobile operating systems and antivirus tools up to date. Be especially wary of scanning unknown QR codes or approving unsolicited app downloads (a common vector in quishing) ([Adelaide Now](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/private-investigator-evan-frangos-gives-dire-warning-on-new-qr-code-scam-fleecing-thousands-of-dollars-from-people/news-story/e933c00250e9eb86b7ea49176d2da84c?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### **4\. Manage Your Identity & Finances Proactively**

* Use strong, unique passwords and consider reputable password managers.

* Monitor financial statements and credit reports regularly; report losses or theft immediately to banks and authorities.

### **5\. Know the Psychology of Deception**

* Scammers often exploit urgency, authority, fear, or familiarity. Recognizing emotional triggers (e.g. panic over a payment delay) helps you pause before responding ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/us-news/cyber-scams-are-skyrocketing-costing-americans-16b/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
